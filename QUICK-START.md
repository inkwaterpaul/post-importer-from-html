## Example HTML Structure

The plugin expects this structure (based on your Birmingham HTML files):

```html
<h1>An even warmer welcome at St James, Shirley</h1>

<div class="page-content">
    <p>St James' Church, Shirley have just replaced...</p>
    <p>More content here...</p>
</div>

<div><small> 6th January 2026</small></div>
```

## Testing

For your first import:
1. Start with just 1-2 files
2. Import as "Draft" status
3. Review the imported posts
4. Check that title, content, and date are correct

## Tips

- ✓ All imports are logged for tracking

## Support
